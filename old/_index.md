I am a PhD candidate in Finance, focusing on commodity markets through the lens of asset pricing and risk management. I hold an Master in Banking and Finance from the University of Paris Nanterre, and have five years of commodity market analyst experience, working for consulting and trading companies. From both academic and work experiences, I also have strong interest in new machine learning methods (applied on natural language processing and Finance) and algorithmic high-frequency / latency trading. I am a French citizen, currently based in Switzerland...
